I assumed that the json data wouldn't be too big and therefore, to keep it simple, I save it to a file rather than creatinga sql lite data base, but i think that would be a good solution as well
Depending on the requirements
I used Retrofit library for turn your REST API into a Java interface.
I used Picasso library for image downloading and caching.
